This is a repository for the master's thesis named *Multi-Channel Attribution and Conversion Prediction in Digital Marketing. The Case of a Nonprofit Organisation* 

Files contained in this repo include: 

`SQL_SOS_MT_data_v2.sql` - it contains the SQL query used to access the data internally stored in a relational database 

`requirements.txt` - file of package and version requirements. Valid for both Python 3.9 and Python 3.8.8 

Folder `analysis`, which contains the jupyter notebooks done for the descriptive (`EDA_FINAL.ipynb`) and modelling (`model_FINAL.ipynb`) analysis. 

In order to do the analysis, a virtual environment was created. Visual Studio Code was used to create the Jupyter Notebooks. There, the interpreter of the created virtual environment was selected. Packages were installed from the Windows console, once inside the (activated) virtual environment. Installed packages were then pushed into the `requirements.txt` file.
